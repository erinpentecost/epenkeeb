# EPEN Layout

This layout works with rev2.0-rev2.5 Iris keyboards using 2u thumb keys and white backlight LEDs. It's a Colemak layout that is roughly based on the Pok3r.


Put this in `qmk_firmware/keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps/epen`
Then run with `qmk compile -kb keebio/iris/rev2 -km epen`

Then go into bootloader mode.
Then do `qmk flash -kb keebio/iris/rev2 -km epen`
